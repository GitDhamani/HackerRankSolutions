/*
If you were to run this program without srand(), you'd get the same output every time because what you get is a random sequence
where each number in the sequence is different and everytime you call rand() you pull the next number in the sequence.

However srand, randomises the seed so each sequence is different for every program run and it's randomly seeded because it's based
on the current time. The time(NULL) function returns the number of seconds that have passed since Jan 1st 1970.

If you wanted a random number between 1-20, you'd do rand()%20 + 1.
The reason for the +1 is because when you %20 for example, you'll only get outputs of 0-19, so to get 1 - 20, you add 1.
