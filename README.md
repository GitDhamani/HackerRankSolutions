HackerRank Solutions in C++

HackerRank is a website very similar to leetcode, and is used to keep your coding skills sharp. I first encountered it during interviews to become a software developer and have been using it on and off ever since. I still find some of the solutions that I come up with, or see others produce, truly remarkable and elegant. 

You can find my HackerRank profile here.
My favourite solutions to some of the problems in the github repository HERE.
