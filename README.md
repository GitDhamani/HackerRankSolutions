HackerRank Solutions in C++

HackerRank is a website very similar to leetcode, and is used to keep your coding skills sharp. I first encountered it during interviews to become a software developer and have been using it on and off ever since. I still find some of the solutions that I come up with, or see others produce, truly remarkable and elegant. 

You can find my HackerRank profile here: https://www.hackerrank.com/m_dhamani

My favourite solutions to some of the problems are in this github repository.
