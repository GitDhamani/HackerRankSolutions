So here you just peel off the end digit with %16 and add the hex value of it to a string 
using concatenation. You then divide the number by 16 to discard that end digit.
Now remember the number comes in as a decimal not hex, so we're doing the modding to get
the equivalent value in hex. We keep doing this for as long as the number is greater than zero.
We then return the string.
